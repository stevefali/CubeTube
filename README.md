## Welcome to my first 3D game!

### Main focus of this project: Procedural Generation with Perlin Noise and 3D game development

This project is my submission for the technical interview challenge for the Intern Unity Developer position with Nex Level Gaming.

I have had a ton of fun working on this project, and trying out Unity development for the first time!

As of end-of-day on Monday, October 28, 2024, this project is sadly not yet complete. I had hoped to be able to deliver an MVP before the deadline, but was unable due to my busy work schedule this week and other commitments.

However, I am proud of what I have been able to accomplish so far, considering that I have no prior experience with Unity or C# development, or procedural generation either. 

My initial idea was to generate the playing area using blocks as 3D tiles. However, that ended up making the game slow down quite a bit from having to render so many game objects. I instead moved to this method of creating walls, floors, and ceiling with long, rectangular blocks to save on the number of game objects required and to also shorten development time a bit for this iteration by being able to essentially produce 2D procedurally generated maps and then give them the third dimension by making the blocks long on the third axis.




### Here are a couple of screenshots of what the procedurally generated map looks like so far:

### There is currently a bug that sometimes occurs where the walls turn out straight
