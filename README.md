## Welcome to my first 3D game!

### Main focus of this project: Procedural Generation and 3D game development

This project is my submission for the technical interview challenge for the Intern Unity Developer position with Nex Level Gaming.

I have had a ton of fun working on this project, and trying out Unity development for the first time!

As of end-of-day on Monday, October 28, 2024, this project is sadly not yet complete. I had hoped to be able to deliver an MVP before the deadline, but was unable due to my busy work schedule this week and other commitments.

However, I am proud of what I have been able to accomplish so far, considering that I have no prior experience with Unity or C# development, or procedural generation either. 

### Here are a couple of screenshots of what the procedurally generated map looks like so far:
